We hope you're having a good time doing doing discourse on any of your questions.

00:05.460 --> 00:08.340
We are having great fun creating discourse for you.

00:08.360 --> 00:13.210
One of the important things I would want to highlight is the fact that all the code examples that we're

00:13.230 --> 00:19.570
seeing as part of the PDAF are also present inside the good repository.

00:19.740 --> 00:25.170
So if you import the project and play around with it you learn even more.

00:25.320 --> 00:32.970
So for example some of the examples that we looked at during the interface's airplane bird flyable interface

00:32.970 --> 00:39.120
rules and things like that and you can see all the examples that we used in the inheritance as well.

00:39.300 --> 00:43.480
And we discuss inheritance all writing and all loading as well.

00:43.530 --> 00:50.550
And those examples are down here and you can see the inheritance examples that we look at in here as

00:50.580 --> 00:53.990
well also equals hash code and two string examples.

00:54.030 --> 01:01.080
So all the examples that we are to up V.F. talked about are present inside the entire project.

01:01.080 --> 01:05.650
I would really recommend you to do an exercise where you try and see these examples.

01:05.660 --> 01:12.330
Run them understand them and spend some time with them because when you look at it at a high level that's

01:12.360 --> 01:12.830
good.

01:12.930 --> 01:16.790
But the real learning comes when you look at them in that search.

01:16.830 --> 01:22.410
I would really request to you recommend you to spend some time with these examples open the class see

01:22.410 --> 01:28.650
what's in there and try and generate the code yourself and try and see if you can run these programs

01:28.680 --> 01:34.710
try learn more and do post any questions that you have with these examples.

01:34.770 --> 01:40.410
I would recommend you to spend at least half an hour to 45 minutes looking at these examples as an exercise

01:40.680 --> 01:42.360
I would see you in the next step.
