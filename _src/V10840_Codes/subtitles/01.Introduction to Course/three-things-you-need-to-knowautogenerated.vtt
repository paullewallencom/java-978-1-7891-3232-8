There are three things that you would need to know before we start with this.

00:06.300 --> 00:09.060
Let's discuss those in this mall with you.

00:09.060 --> 00:15.280
The first thing is all the code that we use during this course is pleasant on a good hand possibly.

00:15.420 --> 00:21.990
So you can go to get her dot com slash in 20:28 jargon to your questions and answers and you'd be able

00:21.990 --> 00:26.090
to see all the code that we use during this course.

00:26.100 --> 00:28.960
This link should also be available in the resources.

00:28.960 --> 00:34.710
The second thing is the PTF guide the PDA guide would act as a quick reference whenever you want to

00:34.710 --> 00:37.290
refresh what we have discussed in this court.

00:37.650 --> 00:42.970
Go to the resources section of the video and you should be able to download the PDA of guide from there.

00:43.080 --> 00:46.400
We use a clip to show the code examples in discourse.

00:46.650 --> 00:52.720
The PDA here has detailed instructions on how you can install Eclipse Java and Aalto.

00:52.860 --> 00:58.640
You can import the code from this particular repository so that it's available for easy reference.

00:58.650 --> 01:05.220
Those are the three things that we wanted to discuss during this step get a repository up idea of guide

01:05.520 --> 01:07.410
and how you can install Eclipse.

01:07.500 --> 01:11.850
Once you have this ready and set up you're ready to get started with the cause.

01:11.970 --> 01:13.200
Let's get started.
