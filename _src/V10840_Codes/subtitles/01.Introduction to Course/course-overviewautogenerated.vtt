00:01.670 --> 00:07.130
This we do really give you a quick overview of how we will discuss different questions and different

00:07.130 --> 00:14.930
topics during these cops in the schools would follow the order which is in the media guide the exact

00:14.930 --> 00:20.000
order of the questions in the guide is the order in which we will discuss things in the schools.

00:20.120 --> 00:26.030
If you are interested in a specific section then you can jump around that specific video because that's

00:26.030 --> 00:27.430
the order we would take.

00:27.470 --> 00:31.580
For example if you're not really interested in the basics and you want to skip the first 20 questions

00:31.580 --> 00:35.640
you can do that and you can move on to the other topics directly.

00:35.660 --> 00:43.160
We start off with the Java platform JDK JVM Geddie platform dependent and this kind of stuff we would

00:43.160 --> 00:51.530
move into the basics like we're apat classes trollings Jawaid an object oriented language and we would

00:51.650 --> 00:54.830
discuss the basics of object oriented programming.

00:54.830 --> 01:00.580
Next we discuss a class object to string equals and a lot of other things.

01:00.620 --> 01:06.830
During the subsequent actions we will also talk about interface abstraction and constructors.

01:06.860 --> 01:12.740
We also discuss a few Object-Oriented concepts in the Edwins or do you object to the contexts like coupling

01:12.740 --> 01:19.360
Cohon polymorphism encapsulation in classes starting in classes and anonymous class.

01:19.400 --> 01:21.230
Then we move into modifiers.

01:21.230 --> 01:27.620
The default class modifier a private package access protected static final and all that kind of good

01:27.620 --> 01:28.790
stuff.

01:28.800 --> 01:35.120
After looking at a few examples on conditions and loops we move into the all important topic of exception

01:35.120 --> 01:35.810
handling.

01:35.960 --> 01:40.910
There are a lot of miscellaneous topics that will cover as part of the miscellaneous topic section at

01:40.910 --> 01:43.670
the end of which we move into collections.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.620
We also discuss about Grant collections.

01:45.630 --> 01:49.000
Lexington nice collection concurrent collections and things like that.

01:49.070 --> 01:56.240
Then we would move into topics like generics multi-threading and functional programming with lambda

01:56.240 --> 01:58.090
expressions and streams.

01:58.110 --> 02:02.840
We in the course by discussing different new features which were introduced in previous versions of

02:02.870 --> 02:09.500
Joe Erlichman going through the PTF guide to understand the exact order of the specific topic you are

02:09.500 --> 02:11.320
interested in might be discussed.

02:11.420 --> 02:16.760
The idea behind this video was to just give you an overview of the specific order in which we discuss

02:16.760 --> 02:18.430
things in this code.

02:18.470 --> 02:24.410
If you take the guide and spend some time with it you should be able to easily figure out where a specific

02:24.410 --> 02:25.880
question might be.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.490
We are excited to start with the real questions.

02:28.510 --> 02:30.880
Indeed next we do and then we're at.
