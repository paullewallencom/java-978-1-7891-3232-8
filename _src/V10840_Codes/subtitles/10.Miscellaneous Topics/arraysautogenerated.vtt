00:00.930 --> 00:06.470
You come to this section on miscellaneous topics where we would talk about a lot of different topics

00:06.590 --> 00:09.720
in Jowa we would start with things like race.

00:09.730 --> 00:17.570
We would we did things like enim where the argument is is garbage collection and initialization blocks

00:17.880 --> 00:25.310
static Schley's the serialization and then we would look at what are the different things which would

00:25.310 --> 00:27.530
happen as part of serialization.

00:27.530 --> 00:30.730
These are kind of topics which do not fit in anywhere.

00:30.740 --> 00:36.060
So what we decided to do is create this section called miscellaneous topics and discuss those questions

00:36.140 --> 00:38.150
in this specific topic.

00:38.150 --> 00:42.510
So let's get started with areas and slowly we would move on to other topics.

00:42.530 --> 00:45.510
So what are the default values in an array.

00:45.770 --> 00:51.350
So basically when you look at areas if you don't really initialize them with values then they would

00:51.350 --> 00:53.810
have certain things called default value.

00:53.810 --> 00:56.520
So here I am creating a mocs to an array.

00:56.660 --> 01:02.690
I'm just saying it's 8.5 so integer array of five containing five elements.

01:02.690 --> 01:09.300
So if you're looking I'm trying to print up a value box to have zero footprint of value zero.

01:09.470 --> 01:14.050
So any area is initialized with default values.

01:14.210 --> 01:16.610
So the default values are as shown here.

01:16.610 --> 01:23.670
So for all the integer long by chart kind of things it's zero float zero point system for Boullion.

01:23.690 --> 01:24.540
It's false.

01:24.560 --> 01:26.720
However if it's an object.

01:26.720 --> 01:31.090
So let's say there's a class and I'm creating objects or that particular class.

01:31.250 --> 01:33.410
They'll all be assigned to null.

01:33.560 --> 01:40.520
So you'd see that all the primitive values are initialized but not any objects.

01:40.550 --> 01:46.910
If you find array consists of objects and you're creating an array with a few elements the objects are

01:46.910 --> 01:53.300
not really in sheilas they would still be in the enhanced for loop is one of the easiest ways to loop

01:53.300 --> 01:56.690
around there is so you do for a Mark Marks.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.320
I mean that kind of the common thing.

01:59.570 --> 02:02.060
So how do you can print the contents of an address.

02:02.060 --> 02:06.930
So let's say I have an area and I would want to print the content to output or log or something of that.

02:06.980 --> 02:09.560
And there are a few tricky things in here.

02:09.560 --> 02:11.670
So let's discuss that right now.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.870
So I have an array max 5.

02:14.040 --> 02:20.390
And if I print it out the Prindle and modify what it print is not the content of the array but what

02:20.390 --> 02:26.810
it really prints is where this area is in memory so it kind of prints the hash code or the hash code

02:26.810 --> 02:28.660
for that particular area.

02:28.910 --> 02:36.590
So if I really want to print the Mock's content like this I would need to use areas start to string

02:37.120 --> 02:41.610
to string is this tactic method which is present in the base class.

02:41.690 --> 02:48.420
So we need to use the areas that string method to print the content of error.

02:48.830 --> 02:52.060
Let's say there is two damage Larry.

02:52.220 --> 02:53.670
The There's a metrics.

02:53.780 --> 02:56.820
So this metrics is a two dimensional matrix.

02:56.960 --> 03:00.350
So I have this do that thing and I'm printing matics.

03:00.380 --> 03:03.080
What does it print it print.

03:03.380 --> 03:09.710
As I said Of course it's printing the what is the memory address or something of that kind.

03:09.870 --> 03:16.100
So if you do resort to string on Matrix 3 what does it print it print the starting location of this

03:16.150 --> 03:19.140
area and the starting location of this.

03:19.220 --> 03:21.890
So it's printing these do stuff.

03:21.900 --> 03:27.380
But if you really want to print the content of the areas you need to use something called Erris dark

03:27.800 --> 03:29.780
deep blue string.

03:29.780 --> 03:34.700
So that's what you'd need to use to print the content off of it.

03:34.770 --> 03:40.790
So if you are really interested in printing the content of an area you need to use editor to bring or

03:40.900 --> 03:46.540
edit the two string you to one area then you can go with it or string if it's a two dimensional array.

03:46.550 --> 03:49.430
Then you need to go with that is start deep to string.

03:49.550 --> 03:53.780
This always interesting question how do you really compare to this.

03:53.780 --> 03:58.400
So the way you would compare arrays by using something called equal.

03:58.400 --> 04:06.680
So this static method call equals in areas so these equals method is used to determine where the two

04:06.680 --> 04:08.120
areas are equal.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.140
Most important thing is two areas are equal.

04:10.160 --> 04:17.400
Only if they contain the same element same numbers in all positions.

04:17.420 --> 04:23.320
So it's like if let's say every one to three and the other one is three to one.

04:23.390 --> 04:25.380
Then those are not really well.

04:25.610 --> 04:31.700
So for areas to be equal they should have the elements same elements in all position to push in zero

04:31.910 --> 04:34.430
one position to push in one.

04:34.580 --> 04:36.760
It's two position to three.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.900
And also the size of these two areas.

04:38.900 --> 04:40.370
Number one and number three matter.

04:40.380 --> 04:44.790
So when you say it is not equal to number one coming in but three to print.

04:45.010 --> 04:49.740
So those are some of the interesting things about race.

04:49.790 --> 04:57.260
What I would recommend you to do if you are interested is look at various examples in the workspace

04:57.350 --> 05:03.650
you'd have any examples class has a lot of things about it.

05:03.860 --> 05:10.720
So a lot of finer details about areas are declared or are explained in this thing.

05:10.830 --> 05:17.010
So you can take a quick look on this as a exercise you can plan understand what's happening in there

05:17.340 --> 05:21.160
and you can post any questions that you have on the form.

05:21.210 --> 05:29.790
In this video you'll get a few questions around areas and we also look at where we can find more information

05:29.790 --> 05:35.310
about race and what are the other things that you might be interested regarding Edwards ask for this

05:35.310 --> 05:36.750
interview questions or concern.
