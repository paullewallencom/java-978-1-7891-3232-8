00:02.640 --> 00:06.350
Let's not talk about another important concept called enim.

00:06.390 --> 00:13.060
Typically what we're used to in Java is to use strings to represent a different set of values.

00:13.170 --> 00:20.670
So I can use the string winder string Springs putting some and string fall to represent the fact that

00:21.720 --> 00:30.060
to represent the seasons the fact is that all these four together have something in common they're all

00:30.150 --> 00:31.720
different seasons.

00:31.730 --> 00:40.020
So Jawa has created this thing called ENM where you can define all the possible values a specific type

00:40.030 --> 00:41.140
can have.

00:41.190 --> 00:46.010
So the season can have forwell use winter spring summer and fall.

00:46.200 --> 00:54.600
And no I can have all these values in a single type and we can use seasonal or winter or season of spring

00:54.600 --> 01:01.180
season summer season or fall as these basic values for that particular in them.

01:01.210 --> 01:07.290
So this would love us writing code like this like for example one of the things we should be able to

01:07.290 --> 01:12.500
do is use a switch around them so I can do a switch around the genome.

01:12.660 --> 01:19.030
And basically we are like we have a method which is getting the expected maximum pressure.

01:19.050 --> 01:21.610
So if it's winter then we are doing fine spring and fall.

01:21.610 --> 01:23.830
We're reading in summer it's 20.

01:24.120 --> 01:31.020
This looks like some European country nice weather even in summer it doesn't do more than 20 degrees

01:31.020 --> 01:32.070
Celsius.

01:32.070 --> 01:34.400
So that's good weather.

01:34.410 --> 01:41.510
We can look at further Edwins examples of them in two classes in Grant and in them at once do.

01:41.710 --> 01:45.060
So let's quickly look at in advance.

01:45.210 --> 01:48.610
So the first thing is you can have it earlier.

01:48.610 --> 01:52.150
We'll have that in way where it was just winter spring summer and fall.

01:52.290 --> 02:00.240
But if he has a constructor defined so here I have it with a constructor defined and customized with

02:00.330 --> 02:01.290
in code.

02:01.290 --> 02:04.600
So now I have a variable in the name as well.

02:04.710 --> 02:07.140
So now I can define a value.

02:07.150 --> 02:13.560
So winder de-value this one spring the value is to some of the values to the fall the values for.

02:13.830 --> 02:19.590
And I can even have a called Get chord method to return the chord for a specific season.

02:19.890 --> 02:23.590
The other thing we can also create is a value of method.

02:23.670 --> 02:29.970
So given a specific value so the value of meant that what it does is if you pass a value to it don't

02:30.120 --> 02:34.080
spring if you will for pass a value for it and false.

02:34.170 --> 02:39.870
So what it does is it looks loops through the seasons and checks where the record matches record matches

02:39.870 --> 02:40.540
then it returns.

02:40.530 --> 02:42.570
That's this week's season man thing.

02:42.690 --> 02:46.510
And we already look at this get expected max temperature thing.

02:46.590 --> 02:54.360
So this would be this would allow this is using a switch to switch over this particular enim instance

02:54.750 --> 02:55.450
to return.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.610
What is the max expected temperature.

02:57.720 --> 03:06.550
So these are this is like an advanced Inam where we are assigning a code for that specific Inam value.

03:06.660 --> 03:15.240
And also we are having a method where you'd be able to convert the ESM into code or be called into him

03:15.540 --> 03:16.650
you can see that in here.

03:16.650 --> 03:20.600
So I'm saying See then don't get go slow season is a cold winter.

03:20.630 --> 03:21.570
So is get good.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.420
What does it return.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.010
One.

03:23.040 --> 03:23.350
Right.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.760
So Susan the core of winter is one that's true.

03:26.910 --> 03:33.050
And you can see see Zehnder get expected maximum temperature because the season is winter it would return.

03:33.060 --> 03:35.160
It would go to this method and it would return fire.

03:35.160 --> 03:38.960
So I would be printed and season customized value of four.

03:39.030 --> 03:42.270
So what season has a value of four.

03:42.360 --> 03:45.400
It's false that this would print fall in.

03:45.420 --> 03:51.900
So this is Edwins example of an enum where we are doing a lot more than the basic just having a list

03:51.900 --> 03:53.170
of values.

03:53.280 --> 04:01.170
And there's another one to ocean off ENM here where we are actually extending the ENM directly so here

04:01.200 --> 04:07.950
you are looking at I'm saying winter and I'm defending a customized method on there so I'm saying this

04:07.950 --> 04:15.660
is winter and the customized method is written five and the same kind of metal I'm putting on summer

04:16.050 --> 04:17.590
and the default metal.

04:17.730 --> 04:19.120
I can put it in here.

04:19.140 --> 04:21.420
So the default method is this.

04:21.480 --> 04:26.390
And for these two values are overriding the method and giving a new value.

04:26.530 --> 04:29.850
I mean this is just to show you what is possible within them.

04:29.850 --> 04:31.440
These are really complex.

04:31.650 --> 04:37.170
I would really why this kind of a code in the real prediction scenario is just to kind of give you a

04:37.410 --> 04:40.170
picture of what are the different things that are possible.

04:40.410 --> 04:44.040
But then you can have a variable you can have value.

04:44.100 --> 04:47.910
You can have a method and different kinds of things.

04:47.970 --> 04:52.770
I would recommend you to go to these a number once and you might want to and play around with these

04:52.770 --> 04:56.750
glasses to get their idea about what's happening in here.

04:56.820 --> 05:03.120
In this we deal we started with basic income and we looked at a couple of advanced examples of is really

05:03.240 --> 05:05.910
its methods and that as well.

05:05.910 --> 05:07.770
So I'm in the next media way.
