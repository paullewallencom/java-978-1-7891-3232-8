00:00.570 --> 00:06.730
Let's not discuss about the bull arguments what are the arguments and what are the advantages that pro-white

00:06.760 --> 00:07.160
does.

00:07.170 --> 00:12.910
If you look at this method which is present some end followed by three Daut and a bite.

00:13.050 --> 00:20.670
So basically this is a variable argument Berryville argument is something which can accept multiple

00:20.730 --> 00:23.250
parameters of this type.

00:23.250 --> 00:30.690
So now what I would be able to do is when I define a method of this kind I can call it with three parameters

00:30.870 --> 00:34.550
for parameter or no parameters at all.

00:34.560 --> 00:40.500
So that's the flexibility that variable argument me legal arguments allowed me to call this method with

00:40.800 --> 00:43.660
any number of Badami this.

00:43.680 --> 00:51.450
So the Jawa implement this is once I define a variable as a variable argument.

00:51.450 --> 00:57.040
Then what I'd like Devey you'd be able to access the values are like an area.

00:57.220 --> 01:00.710
So these numbers is almost like an array in here.

01:00.720 --> 01:07.800
So I can loop around the numbers and I can take all the numbers and sum them up numbers is almost like

01:07.800 --> 01:09.050
an average.

01:09.180 --> 01:12.100
So this is basically what variable arguments are.

01:12.270 --> 01:18.540
So if you want to have some method for example here which is accepting three parameters.

01:18.610 --> 01:20.390
I mean what about those that are passed.

01:20.730 --> 01:22.040
You want to sum them up.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.150
This is a good way of defining it.

01:24.150 --> 01:26.970
This would have allowed me to create multiple methods.

01:27.150 --> 01:30.150
Accepting different number of arguments.

01:30.300 --> 01:33.930
So we'll look at a few tricky things regarding variable arguments.

01:33.940 --> 01:38.810
Now as we look at it earlier it's basically the type followed by three dots.

01:38.940 --> 01:40.410
This becomes a number.

01:40.470 --> 01:43.660
Now you can go here and say numbers door length.

01:43.700 --> 01:45.110
So simple to an Eric.

01:45.220 --> 01:50.740
There's a property called Lent which gives you the things so numbers inside it's actually like an error.

01:50.760 --> 01:53.010
You can see numbers is in.

01:53.190 --> 01:57.680
So internally it's being represented almost like an area.

01:57.750 --> 02:00.660
And so you can loop around it and things like that.

02:00.840 --> 02:06.200
So as we look it in here three arguments for arguments are arguments.

02:06.210 --> 02:12.030
The important thing about variable arguments is variable arguments should always be the last part of

02:12.030 --> 02:13.200
the method.

02:13.230 --> 02:20.210
You cannot have a variable argument as a first barometer of the method or in between the arguments of

02:20.300 --> 02:25.860
it that it should always be the last parameter of him and that it makes sense because if it's not the

02:25.860 --> 02:31.050
last parameter of the emitter and let's say you're calling it in this way then how do you how does one

02:31.050 --> 02:32.730
know which one is which.

02:32.730 --> 02:36.250
So that's the reason why Babydol argument should always be last baramin.

02:36.300 --> 02:42.720
So if you create a method like this you would get a compilation of not only simple types but even a

02:43.350 --> 02:46.730
complex class can be used as and with the argument.

02:46.860 --> 02:50.620
So if you look at this particular thing I'm having a bar.

02:50.660 --> 02:56.970
All right then with animals and I'm calling the looping around the animals and calling Department.

02:57.180 --> 03:02.700
So now I can call this bark method by passing a list of animals to it.

03:02.760 --> 03:07.440
So the thing is for using available argument it does not have to be a simple type.

03:07.440 --> 03:07.960
I mean it.

03:08.100 --> 03:12.720
I mean it it doesn't have to be a primitive or any of the simple things you can use very arguments with

03:12.870 --> 03:15.480
any of the complex types as well.

03:15.480 --> 03:18.060
In short we do video we looked at what are the arguments.

03:18.120 --> 03:21.010
When do you use the arguments.

03:21.180 --> 03:25.740
How do you create a method with where the argument and the fact that the argument should always be the

03:25.740 --> 03:28.560
last argument in a specific method.

03:28.560 --> 03:32.040
Also we look at the fact that variable argument.

03:32.220 --> 03:36.630
Even complex classes can be declared as we document.

03:36.630 --> 03:38.410
So those are the important things.

03:38.430 --> 03:44.880
I would recommend to play around with the variable arguments examples and get comfortable with the concept

03:44.880 --> 03:47.580
of the document until the next redo.
