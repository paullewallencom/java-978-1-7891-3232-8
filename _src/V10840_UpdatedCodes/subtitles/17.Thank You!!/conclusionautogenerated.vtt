Welcome back in this job interview guide we took a deep dive into Java and looked at a varied range

00:08.100 --> 00:16.170
of Java concepts creating a course on job interview questions is really a huge risk a job was so vast

00:16.380 --> 00:22.320
that it's absolutely impossible to cover everything that is important be there are people with different

00:22.320 --> 00:28.170
skill levels who are preparing for interviews who have different expectations and it's very difficult

00:28.170 --> 00:29.670
to match all of them.

00:29.680 --> 00:32.960
Our aim with this course was not to cover everything.

00:33.090 --> 00:39.900
Our aim was to help you revise the important concepts in a very short period of time with a lot of code

00:39.930 --> 00:41.140
examples.

00:41.160 --> 00:43.760
We hope we are successful in that endeavor.

00:43.800 --> 00:49.740
One of the important things we recommend you to do is to complete the exercises which were recommended

00:49.770 --> 00:51.490
at the end of every BDO.

00:51.510 --> 00:56.280
We also recommend you to set up all the examples which are present on the Get her repository.

00:56.280 --> 01:00.380
There is never an end to learning and preparing for a job interview.

01:00.390 --> 01:05.370
So what we have done is on to get her proposal into engagement is Jawan to your questions and answers

01:06.270 --> 01:10.180
at the bottom of the page where we'll get all the questions.

01:10.240 --> 01:13.180
There's a section called what you can do next.

01:13.200 --> 01:18.780
The topics which are mentioned in here might be some of those which you would want to focus on next.

01:18.780 --> 01:21.730
Good luck with the preparation for your job interview.

01:21.730 --> 01:24.760
I think we see you in another 28 minutes.

01:24.960 --> 01:25.550
This is wrong.

01:25.560 --> 01:26.920
Signing off.

01:26.970 --> 01:29.030
Take care and good luck.

01:29.040 --> 01:29.380
Bye.
