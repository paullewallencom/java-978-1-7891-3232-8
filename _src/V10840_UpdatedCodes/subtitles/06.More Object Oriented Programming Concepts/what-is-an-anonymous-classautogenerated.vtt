The next thing which we want to discuss in this short video is an anonymous class.

00:05.690 --> 00:09.340
And then with is basically one which does not have a name.

00:09.430 --> 00:12.110
So how can you really create a class which does not have any.

00:12.160 --> 00:15.580
If you look at the Animal class here the Animal class has a name right.

00:15.590 --> 00:17.460
This has a name called animal.

00:17.680 --> 00:24.340
However if I want to really create a anonymous class I can do something of this kind here I'm creating

00:24.340 --> 00:31.390
I'm a competitor so to implement the competitor interface I would need to override a method call it

00:31.700 --> 00:32.570
compare.

00:32.770 --> 00:41.020
So what I'm doing here is instead of defining a new competitor classing up some competitor extents implements

00:41.020 --> 00:46.810
competitor what I'm doing is emphatically creating the body of the class in here.

00:46.810 --> 00:53.020
So I'm defining dimethyl here and within open Breske close place and defining the complete Berretta

00:53.110 --> 00:54.240
right here.

00:54.250 --> 01:01.830
So this is a reverse comp. So basically price and reverses the order of the strings.

01:01.840 --> 01:08.430
I mean it kind of like it tries in reverse the alphabetical order of strings.

01:08.590 --> 01:13.830
So if you use the reverse comparator you'd see that this particular thing when I say apple.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.620
Boy it trippin in God boy Apple.

01:16.760 --> 01:24.670
That's one example of an anonymous class where I'm not really creating a class but I'm trying to directly

01:24.670 --> 01:28.740
define a class without a name right here.

01:28.990 --> 01:33.980
The other instances when I want to or I debark it in the new I'm getting a new animal.

01:34.030 --> 01:35.740
But in this new animal I want.

01:35.740 --> 01:37.160
All right debark.

01:37.360 --> 01:38.600
So I would want to say.

01:38.800 --> 01:39.270
All right.

01:39.280 --> 01:43.810
And instead of finding whatever that is printing I would want to see a subclass Barch.

01:43.990 --> 01:48.410
So you'd see that when I do animal back it create prints that subclass box.

01:48.700 --> 01:54.970
This is basically creating a new subclass of the animal so I'm Cregan you sapless of the animal but

01:54.970 --> 01:58.600
I don't want to really create a class and create a instance of it.

01:58.600 --> 02:02.940
So what I'm doing in here is directly creating an instance without a name.

02:02.980 --> 02:09.630
Usually anonymous classes are not really good things to create because they'll not be able to.

02:09.650 --> 02:14.410
I mean you know the name of the class so you'll not be able to reuse it anywhere else.

02:14.410 --> 02:21.430
So these basic instances where you use anonymous classes are weird you know for sure that a specific

02:21.430 --> 02:23.510
class will not be used again.

02:23.710 --> 02:30.220
So if I'm 100 percent sure that this specific thing is very very limited and it's only applicable in

02:30.220 --> 02:34.530
this specific scenario I would go and create an add on my skills.

02:34.570 --> 02:37.760
But usually it's a thing you try and avoid.

02:37.780 --> 02:44.020
So it's a good question but not really something you would want to use in the real world scenario.

02:44.020 --> 02:49.170
Most of the things that you're MIT must class until the next week you rely.
