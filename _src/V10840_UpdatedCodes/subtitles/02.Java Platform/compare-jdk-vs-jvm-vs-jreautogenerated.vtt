00:01.880 --> 00:06.980
There are different terminologies which are used around the Java development and we don't want you hear

00:06.980 --> 00:13.810
things like JDK Jerry JVM What does this and what's the difference between each one of them.

00:13.850 --> 00:16.270
That's what we will discuss in this next question.

00:16.280 --> 00:21.380
When you talk about a job program what are the different things that you would do you'd want to compile

00:21.380 --> 00:22.540
Java programs.

00:22.580 --> 00:23.290
So that's one.

00:23.300 --> 00:30.650
So that basically you would want to be able to compile the Java code create the class files or create

00:30.650 --> 00:32.660
the jar files and things like that.

00:32.660 --> 00:36.770
The second thing you would want to typically do is to run programs.

00:36.920 --> 00:43.080
So you'd want to be able to take a Java class file and prime it or take a jar file and run it.

00:43.100 --> 00:45.950
So that's the second thing you would want to be able to do.

00:45.950 --> 00:49.370
Third thing you would typically do is alter debug programs right.

00:49.370 --> 00:55.720
You'd want to check why something is not working so you'd need if there's a performance problem you

00:55.750 --> 00:58.740
would want to check if what's going wrong.

00:58.740 --> 01:05.120
How much memory is consumed and things like that so that debugging problems or debugging programs those

01:05.120 --> 01:09.380
are the three things that you would typically want to do when you're talking about Java programmers

01:09.530 --> 01:13.000
think it from the perspective of the consumer.

01:13.370 --> 01:17.140
So there are two types of people who use the Java programs right.

01:17.150 --> 01:20.420
One is developers what the developers want to do.

01:20.570 --> 01:27.950
They would want to compile the code and run the code and the other kind of consumers are the users.

01:27.950 --> 01:31.730
So who wants to just use these Jowler programs.

01:31.730 --> 01:38.550
So these guys don't really care about running the I mean they don't care about compiling the programs.

01:38.660 --> 01:45.740
They only want to use the compiled thing so they want to be able to run the Java programs that have

01:45.980 --> 01:48.160
to play a game or something of that kind.

01:48.200 --> 01:57.480
But why Jawa has two different things that are typically used JDK and Jerry JDK is the job of devlopment

01:57.510 --> 02:00.730
kit is the jargon term and we adornment.

02:00.770 --> 02:08.010
So if you want to run any compiled Java code then all that you would need is the Jedi.

02:08.030 --> 02:14.360
If my friend doesn't have a game and he gives me a jar file to run that all that I would need is the

02:14.360 --> 02:19.280
jobber on time and we are argument because I don't want to compile and things like that I don't want

02:19.280 --> 02:19.920
to debug.

02:20.060 --> 02:25.990
But if I'm interested in developing our programs then I need the JDK.

02:26.030 --> 02:33.220
So basically you can think of Jedi as the are meant to run Java programs.

02:33.330 --> 02:38.810
So Jedi's typically consisting of at the base level or JVM Java Virtual Machine.

02:38.870 --> 02:45.600
As we discussed earlier Joel machine kind words the bytecode into executable code.

02:45.860 --> 02:48.680
So that what the JVM does along with it.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.730
The Jedi contains a list of libraries.

02:51.740 --> 03:00.100
Java comes up with a list of different library classes you have a lot of classes in our class.

03:00.110 --> 03:06.200
You have a lot of collections and a lot of other classes which are pleasant in Java.

03:06.380 --> 03:10.360
So you need all of them to be able to run the Java programs.

03:10.430 --> 03:18.650
So Jerry would contain basically the JVM plus all the libraries which are associated with Dauer JDK

03:18.890 --> 03:20.580
in addition to DGT.

03:20.630 --> 03:28.280
It contains the tools that developers would need to adjudicate Jowers devlopment kit and JDK would contain

03:28.580 --> 03:30.560
things like the Java Sea.

03:30.560 --> 03:34.550
That's basically to compile your code and you have your jar thing.

03:34.570 --> 03:40.640
So you want to create a jar file so you use the jar and you have different debugging tools like performant

03:40.640 --> 03:42.250
things and things like that.

03:42.440 --> 03:46.340
So that's basically the get basically to run our programs.

03:46.460 --> 03:51.130
You need Gerry and to develop Jallow programs you need JDK.

03:51.200 --> 03:54.230
Each one of these is a superset of the other.

03:54.230 --> 03:59.140
So Geddie contains JVM all the gifts contain Jerry.

03:59.180 --> 04:03.800
So that's basically JDK was this JVM was very.
